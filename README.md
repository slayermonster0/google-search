## About 
there is an issue where if you search for a real book like "Battle of the Labyrinth" in the console it detects the book name and grabs the apikey then it gives a 400error code(bad request) even though the whole url is correct. but if you put a random name like "book" nothing happens at all we dont understand why this is happening.
